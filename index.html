        <p>C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language.<br>It was developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie. <br>
          At the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. <br>
          C is the most widely used computer language.<br>
          C was initially used for system development work.<br>C is particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.<br> C was adopted as a system development language.<br>Because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language.
          <br>It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language.<br>It is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.<br>C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals <br> A great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain.</p>

            This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.
            <br>C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming.<br>You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers<br> Dynamic type identification.
            <br>C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers.<br> If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.

            The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++.<br>
            Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented language. 
            <br>Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br>
            Python is versatile and can be used to create many different things.

            <br> James Gosling is known as the father of Java.<br> Before Java, its name was Oak.<br> Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.<br>
<br>Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. <br>Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
